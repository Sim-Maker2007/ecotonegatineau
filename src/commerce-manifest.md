# ECOTONE GATINEAU - TRANSACTIONAL ENGINE BLUEPRINT
**Status:** ARCHITECTING CORE COMMERCE LOGIC

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Transform the elite tactical frontend into a fully functional e-commerce engine capable of handling cart logic, user profiles, and secure checkouts.

## 🛠️ THE TRANSACTIONAL STACK
1.  **Framework:** React + Tailwind (Current)
2.  **State Management:** `Zustand` (for an ultra-fast, "Construction-Grade" shopping cart)
3.  **Backend candidate:** `Supabase` (Matches our BuildByMe stack for efficiency) - to handle product inventory, user orders, and wishlists.
4.  **Payments:** `Stripe` integration for pro-level checkout security.

## 📦 COMPONENT ROADMAP (TONIGHT'S SPRINT)
- [ ] **Pro-Cart Sidebar:** High-performance overlay with "Tactical Item Summary."
- [ ] **Universal Inventory Sync:** Centralized `useStore` to track stock levels live.
- [ ] **Checkout Flow:** Modern, single-page summary (Shipping -> Payment -> Confirmation).
- [ ] **Product Detail Matrix:** Expanded view for technical specs (FPS for bows, material for rods).

## 🏔️ NEXT SURGICAL UPDATE:
I am now building the `CartStore.js` and the `CheckoutView.jsx` to handle real math and logic. No more static numbers!
